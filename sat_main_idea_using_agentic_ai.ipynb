    "\n",
    "My first [attempt](https://github.com/PragyanR/GenAI_for_SAT_Prep) to create words in context type question using Llama 3B on A100 was a bit involved from a coding perspective. With the advent of Agentic AI, I was able to generate such questions under 50 lines of code and a prompt template.\n",

These tiny plastic particles often originate from larger debris that breaks down over time. Researchers have started focusing on the impact of microplastics on marine life, particularly filter feeders such as mussels and plankton. These organisms ingest microplastics, which can then bioaccumulate through the food chain, potentially affecting larger marine animals and humans. This area of study is crucial because it highlights the unseen consequences of plastic pollution on ocean health.\n",

      "The evolution of urban street art reveals a gradual shift from illicit graffiti to recognized cultural expression. Initially, graffiti was primarily a form of rebellion and territorial marking among youth, often regarded as vandalism. However, over the decades, street art has gained legitimacy through artistic innovation and community engagement, transforming public spaces into canvases that reflect social issues and local identities. This transformation highlights the changing perception of urban art within society.\n",

      "Recent studies in neuroscience have focused on the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory formation. Researchers have discovered that the hippocampus not only stores memories but also actively reorganizes them during sleep, which enhances long-term retention. This reorganization process involves neural plasticity, allowing the brain to strengthen important memories while discarding irrelevant information. Such findings suggest that memory is not static but dynamic, continuously evolving with experience and rest. Which choice best describes the main idea of the text?\n",
