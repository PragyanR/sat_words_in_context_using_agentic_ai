    "\n",
    "My first [attempt](https://github.com/PragyanR/GenAI_for_SAT_Prep) to create words in context type question using Llama 3B on A100 was a bit involved from a coding perspective. With the advent of Agentic AI, I was able to generate such questions under 50 lines of code and a prompt template.\n",
